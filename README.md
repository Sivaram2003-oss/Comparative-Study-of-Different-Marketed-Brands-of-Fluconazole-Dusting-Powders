# Comparative Study of Different Marketed Brands of Fluconazole Dusting Powders

## Overview
This project evaluates and compares four commercially available Fluconazole dusting powders:  
- **Onecan (B3)**  
- **Swiss Flu (B1)**  
- **Flumet (B2)**  
- **Flubec (B4)**  

The study focuses on their physical properties and antifungal activity to determine the most effective formulation.

## Background
Fungal skin infections are common worldwide, especially in tropical climates. Dermatophytes are the main pathogens responsible for superficial fungal infections. Topical Fluconazole is frequently prescribed for localized fungal infections due to its safety, efficacy, and tolerance. Post-marketing evaluation of formulations ensures consistency in therapeutic performance and patient safety.

## Objective
- Assess physical parameters (appearance, flow properties, particle size) of four marketed Fluconazole dusting powders.  
- Evaluate antifungal activity using in-vitro zone of inhibition studies.  
- Compare brands to determine the most effective formulation.

## Key Findings
- All four brands passed the physical parameter limits.  
- Variations in excipients contributed to differences in antifungal activity.  
- **Onecan (B3)** showed the highest antifungal activity and met all evaluation criteria, making it the most effective brand.

## Conclusion
All tested brands of Fluconazole dusting powders showed acceptable quality. **Onecan (B3)** demonstrated superior antifungal performance and can be recommended for treating fungal infections.

## Recommendations
- Manufacturers should optimize formulations to meet label claims consistently.  
- The Drug Testing Laboratory wing of DFCO should monitor post-marketing product performance.  
- Further studies can include larger sample sizes and clinical trials for validation.
